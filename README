README for security-manager project

The security manager is project forked from security-server, from which
it inherits its main design: division for two parts:
* system daemon (security-manager)
* library for communication with daemon (libsecurity-manager).

The implementation of daemon part is divided into:
    manager part: that is responsible for threads and communication management
    with no awareness of what information is being transferred. This part is
    implemented by SocketManager class that works with GenericSocketService as
    a generalization for services that security-server provides.
and
    services part: implemented as classes derived from GenericSocketService
    grouped in src/server/service directory that defines actions done by
    security-manager after receiving certain requests from client side.

The security-manager's manager part is fully inherited from security-server,
while services are completely diffrent.

The security-manager services are ment to gather information about security
permissions in the system and provide access to that data via means of
libsecurity-manager.
